AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework
About This Template: This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

1. Task Overview
Task Title
Web Scraping for a high school wrestling ranking system

Goal Statement
Goal: I want to be able to access new high school wrestling data as it arrives on trackwrestling and create a ranking system that will ultimately show me who is the best wrestler and dive me an advantage as a college wrestling coach looking to recruit the best talent, and also hidden gems

2. Project Analysis & Current State
Technology & Architecture
Frameworks & Versions: ExpressJS and Embedded Javascript Templates
Language: Node/Javascript, HTML, CSS
Database & ORM: PostgreSQL with Sequilize
UI & Styling: Embedded Javascript Templates
Authentication: Currently no authentication system
Key Architectural Patterns: Express application, MVC
Current State
We have a small organized Express app with several routes. Currently we scrape trackwrestling and pull results data from state tournaments. this gives us a limited dataset and make us very dependent on high school coaches entering the correct record for athletes at the state tournament. We want something more accurate. We want a way to view head to head results for athletes and rank them. 
we have 2 ranking systems: 
- `utilities/perform-elo-calculation.js` contains a util for performing elo calculations
- `utilities/perform-glicko-calculation.js` contains a util for performing glicko calculations

We want to rank athletes using both and show 2 new UI pages
1) A new table that shows athletes, their wins and losses, win percentage, glicko scores, elo, the table should be paginated, and allow sorting and filtering on mutiple criteria
2) an individual athlete view that shows head to head matches and more statistics 

3. Context & Problem Definition
Problem Statement
Its a lot of work to aggregate all the data necessary for recruiting. On top of aggregating data, you have to watch film, vet athletes for culture fit and grades, and schedule visits

Development Mode Context
ðŸš¨ Project Stage: this is an early stage development project
Breaking Changes: Breaking changes are acceptable
Data Handling: leave my database alone. migrations are fine, but dont drop tables
User Base: currently no one, no users, early stage project
Priority: stability and speed are 50/50
