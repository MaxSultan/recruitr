AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework
About This Template: This is a systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. Use this structure to break down complex features, improvements, or fixes into manageable, trackable tasks that AI agents can execute effectively.

1. Task Overview
Task Title
Title: [Brief, descriptive title - e.g., "Add User Authentication System" or "Fix Payment Integration Bug"]

Goal Statement
Goal: [Clear statement of the end result you want and the business/user value it provides]

2. Project Analysis & Current State
Technology & Architecture
Frameworks & Versions: TODO: List your main frameworks and versions
Language: TODO: Specify your programming language and version
Database & ORM: TODO: Define your database and ORM choice
UI & Styling: TODO: List your UI framework and styling approach
Authentication: TODO: Specify your authentication system
Key Architectural Patterns: TODO: List your main architectural patterns
Current State
[Analysis of your current codebase state, existing functionality, and what needs to be changed]

3. Context & Problem Definition
Problem Statement
[Detailed explanation of the problem, including user impact, pain points, and why it needs to be solved now]

Success Criteria
 [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
 [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
 [Specific, measurable outcome 3]
4. Development Mode Context
Development Mode Context
ðŸš¨ Project Stage: TODO: Define if this is new development, production system, or legacy migration
Breaking Changes: TODO: Specify if breaking changes are acceptable or must be avoided
Data Handling: TODO: Define data preservation requirements
User Base: TODO: Describe who will be affected by changes
Priority: TODO: Set your speed vs stability priorities
5. Technical Requirements
Functional Requirements
TODO: Define what users can do and what the system will automatically handle

Example format: "User can [specific action]"
Example format: "System automatically [specific behavior]"
Example format: "When [condition] occurs, then [system response]"
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: TODO: Define response time and load handling requirements
Security: TODO: Specify authentication and data protection needs
Usability: TODO: Set user experience and accessibility standards
Responsive Design: TODO: Define mobile, tablet, desktop support requirements
Theme Support: TODO: Specify light/dark mode and brand requirements
Technical Constraints
[Must use existing system X]
[Cannot modify database table Y]
[Must maintain compatibility with feature Z]
6. Data & Database Changes
Database Schema Changes
TODO: Add your SQL schema changes here (new tables, columns, indexes, etc.)

Data Model Updates
TODO: Define your TypeScript types, interfaces, and data structure changes

Data Migration Plan
TODO: Plan your data migration steps (backup, apply changes, transform data, validate)

7. API & Backend Changes
Data Access Pattern Rules
TODO: Define where different types of code should go in your project (mutations, queries, API routes)

Server Actions
TODO: List your create, update, delete operations and what they do

Database Queries
TODO: Define your data fetching approach (direct queries vs separate functions)

8. Frontend Changes
New Components
TODO: List the new components you need to create and their purpose

Page Updates
TODO: List the pages that need changes and what modifications are required

State Management
TODO: Define your state management approach and data flow strategy

9. Implementation Plan
TODO: Break your work into phases with specific tasks and file paths

10. Task Completion Tracking
Real-Time Progress Tracking
TODO: Define how you want the AI to track and report progress on tasks

11. File Structure & Organization
TODO: Plan what new files to create and existing files to modify

12. AI Agent Instructions
Implementation Workflow
ðŸŽ¯ MANDATORY PROCESS: TODO:

Communication Preferences
TODO: How do you want the agent to communicate with you

Code Quality Standards
TODO: Any specific code standards

13. Second-Order Impact Analysis
Impact Assessment
TODO: Tell the AI what sections of code you're worried about breaking, performance concerns, and user workflow impacts
